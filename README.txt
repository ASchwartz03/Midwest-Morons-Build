CONTROLS / HOW TO PLAY ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The white cube is an enemy, of the other four cubes, the bottom three are troops, and the last one is a builder.

Move the camera with arrow keys or WASD

Zoom the camera in and out with F and R

The small square in the middle of the screen is your cursor. Hover the cursor over a troop or builder and press space to select it. Selecting a troop or builder does not deselect troops and builders that are already selected, so multiple troops and builders can be selected at the same time. Deselect all troops and builders by hovering the cursor over nothing and pressing space.

When a troop is selected, press right shift to move the troop to the location under the cursor. If an enemy is under the cursor, the troop will attack the enemy.

When a builder is selected, move it the same way as a troop. Builders will not attack enemies. While a builder is selected, press B to toggle building mode. Then press Q to place a building.

Quit the game with Esc

GOALS FOR THIS SEMESTER ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Our goal was to have (A) a bare bones alpha build, namely, basic troop movement and attack, and the ability to place buildings, and (B) art and audio begun but not integrated into the project. The build we submitted has troops moving and attacking enemies, and builders that can place buildings. Evidence of our art and audio assets can be found in our milestone 1 and final presentations.
